Compilation instructions (Windows):
1)Download MinGW installer. Launch and it will ask you to
  which components do you want to install. I chose:
  -C Compiler
  -C++ Compiler
  -MSYS Basic System
  -MinGW Developer Toolkit

  I installed MinGW in C:\MinGW

2)Download and build Allegro 5. This tutorial can give you
  pointers on how to build Allegro:

  I did not install Code Blocks.

3)Copy allegro include and lib folders to C:\MinGW.

4)Go to Tron folder, and run make.

If compiling on Windows with MinGW, it is preferred to use MinGW
shell instead of cmd.
