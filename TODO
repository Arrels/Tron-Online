TODO:

-Implement a singleton in Application class. Consider making a
 singleton class.
-Create a Makefile that doesn't require to be updated.
-Consider creating abstract classes and subclasses for:
 Application
 Player
-Create a coding guidelines document.
-Use a static analysis tool before pushing files to repo.
-Implement factory pattern (candidates: application, player, map).

Notes:
Much of the code from Application has been copied from
tutorials. I would like to change this so we only have original
code.
